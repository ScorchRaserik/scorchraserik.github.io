		<div class="summary">
			Ryan is currently a web developer<br>
			and Team Lead at <a href="http://ennovar.wichita.edu/">Ennovar at Wichita State University</a><br>
			<br>
			At Ennovar, Ryan mainly focuses on front-end development using Angular 2 and Meteor.js (as well as basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript),
			but he is also tasked with some back-end development and QA testing for his team when needed.  His day to day tasks range from developing full webpages (such as <a href="http://www.investkit.com/AAPL/Apple-Inc/financial-overview/2636">this one</a>) from photoshop images,
			to smaller modules that will be integrated into multiple webpages (such as the various modules on <a href="http://joyfulhome.com/location/san-diego-ca">this page</a>).
			<br>
			<br>
			Ryan has a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a minor in Creative Writing from Wichita State University.
			For his senior project, he worked with three other seniors on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28l9ajCtHUw">Touch-Enabled Vending Assistant</a>,
			a device that fits over existing vending machines that audibly tells users where items are and the price of the items,
			in order to help blind and low-vision users.<br>
			<br>
			In his very limited free time, Ryan develops small, personal games using Javascript, XNA, and Unity.  He is also a moderator of the
			<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront">/r/StarWarsBattlefront</a> subreddit and is an active member of the
			Star Wars: Battlefront II modding community.

			</ul>
			<div>
				When working on Joyful Home and InvestKit, I was a member of a large team at Ennovar working in tandem with another, larger team at SNT Media.  SNT Media would send us photoshop images of what they
				wanted the webpages to look like, and we would recreate them under the Meteor.js framework in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, using their in-house API and various social APIs such as Disqus or Google Maps.
				<br><br>
				During the DevICT Job Board project, I was one of the team leads in a small group of developers.  The website was designed and developed wholly at Ennovar, with no external documentation to designs to go off of.
				My personal role on the project was to develop the Javascript functionality of the site while my team members designed and developed the HTML and CSS aspects.  I also was in charge of the Quality Assurance of those HTML and CSS pages.
